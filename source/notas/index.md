# Notes

Here lie the notes I've collected over the years. 

Why yes, it's rather sparse here at the moment. I have over a decades worth of text files in my personal notes, and honestly I haven't been diligent in organizing or separating the private from the public. No more.

Hopefully, this will also reduce the burden of those who have to actually go through my private notes when I'm no longer here. And yes, I'd like that to be a long way off.
