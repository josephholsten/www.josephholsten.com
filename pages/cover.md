# Cover Letter

## Blind Opener

I noticed there isn't any mention of hiring on your site. But I'm very interested in
all the stuff you folks have been up to, and I'd love to talk with you
all about if there's a niche I might fit into.


# Generic Infra

I'm writing to let you know I'm interested in the infrastructure position at ${COMPANY}. I'm excited you all are looking for someone with the very same set of skills and experience I have.

While hardly anyone says it explicitly, I know from experience that the real value of a good infrastructure engineer comes from:

- reducing the time-to-recovery & cost of service outages
- improving service delivery so engineering can release features faster & easier
- analyzing and forecasting the costs of infrastructure

That is exactly what I've been delivering for the last 5 years. I can shepherd these sort of projects across the entire application lifecycle from the back-of-a-napkin to long-term-production-operation, and I have:

- worked with stakeholders to find the real functional (and non-functional) requirements,
- built a plan for the smallest set of useful features,
- implemented them without breaking existing work,
- delivered to production with minimal risk,
- rinsed & repeated.

I know you have practically unlimited interesting, challenging work to do with not enough time or people. And you have hard choices to make every day about how to keep being awesome as your business grows. I know I can help keep infrastructure stable while continuing to help engineering deliver more awesome.

You can find more of my professional details in my resume:

I hope to hear from you soon!

# Generic Software Eng

I'm writing to let you know I'm interested in the software engineering position at ${COMPANY}. It seems like you're looking for someone with the very same set of skills and experience I have.

While hardly anyone says it explicitly, I know from experience that the real value of a good software engineer comes not just from:

- adding new business functions to a service

But also from:

- scaling a service to more users
- reducing the costs of providing the service
- reducing the risk (cost/likelyhood) of service outages & errors

That is exactly what I've been delivering for the last decade. I can shepherd projects across the entire application lifecycle from the back-of-a-napkin to long-term-production-operation, and I have:

- worked with stakeholders to find the real functional (and non-functional) requirements,
- built a plan for the smallest set of useful features,
- implemented them without breaking existing work,
- delivered to production with minimal risk,
- rinsed & repeated.

You specifically mentioned a deep knowledge of Ruby and Javascript. 
I wrote the XML processing API in rails[1], have spoken multiple times at Seattle.rb and OK.rb, and even helped organize Red Dirt Ruby Conf. I also was a founder of Bitp.it, a bitcoin mining pool written in node.js (we also had a bitcoin miner that ran in-browser, though it was terrible). But my experience is much more than JS & Ruby, I've had the luck to work on literally more open source projects than I can remember[2].

I know you have practically unlimited interesting, challenging work to do with not enough time or people. And you have hard choices to make every day about whether to use your powers for good or for awesome. I know I can help keep the balance shifted toward awesome.

Duolingo's software engineers are at the forefront of developing the technologies that improve how millions of people learn. We're looking for ideas to improve education from every area of computer science, including natural language processing, artificial intelligence, large-scale system design and user interface design. As a software engineer, 

- youâ€˜d work on a small team (usually less than 5 people) with 
- continuous deployment. We move fast, and 
- we need our engineers to be generalists enough to tackle new challenges as they arise.
- Generate ideas for product changes that improve key metrics
- Work with our world-class design team to prototype these ideas
- Write code to turn the prototypes into high-volume production applications
- Large scale systems design experience with knowledge of Unix/Linux
- Strong coding skills in Python, JavaScript/AJAX, database design and SQL
